**Netlimiter alternative created by a real chicken**
- Automatic blocking of selected Firewall Ports with an easy to use UI to gain an advantage in Destiny 2 as recently 'Netlimiter 4 Pro' was flagged by Battleye.

**Filtered Firewall ports with the use of Hotkeys (unalterable)**
- 3074 // CTRL + X
- 30000 - 30009 // CTRL + V
- 27000 - 27100 // CTRL + B
- 7500 // CTRL + N (don't work in UL, It get you kicked instantly by the game because the port is blocked, and not limited by 1b/s, so all the limit functions need to be rebuild in order to be working properly with 7.5K
- ALT + TAB + SPACE Function

**Extra Application/Functionality**
- Game pauser (Used to prevent Joining Allies in Destiny 2)
- DiscordRPC (Small edits)

**When the application is closed**
- Firewall rules are automatically deleted.
- Hotkeys are removed.
- Extra application is exited.

**Things to consider**
- Real time protection may need to be disabled for components to function as expected.
- This was originally built off D2SoloEnabler by DrNoLife & Woof.
