**Netlimiter alternative created by woof#8834**
- Automatic blocking of selected Firewall Ports with an easy to use UI to gain an advantage in Destiny 2 as recently 'Netlimiter 4 Pro' was flagged by Battleye.

**Filtered Firewall ports with the use of Hotkeys (unalterable)**
- 3074 // CTRL + Z
- 30000 - 30009 // CTRL + X
- 27000 - 27100 // CTRL + C
- ALT + TAB + SPACE Function

**Extra Application/Functionality**
- Game pauser (Used to prevent Joining Allies in Destiny 2)
- DiscordRPC

**When the application is closed**
- Firewall rules are automatically deleted.
- Hotkeys are removed.
- Extra application is exited.

**Things to consider**
- Real time protection may need to be disabled for components to function as expected.
- This was originally built off D2SoloEnabler by DrNoLife.
